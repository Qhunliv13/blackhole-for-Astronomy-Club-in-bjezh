人们总说“A太难，B太高”，可若一听“难”便转身，那“会”的那一天就永远不会到来。好奇不能停在表皮，知识也不该被供上神龛。与其对它“魅”，不如给它“祛魅”——把它请下神坛。学习知识就像拆解一台旧收音机，也许我们不能完全明白每个元件，但至少知道了它并非魔法。

世间学问无穷尽，若先惧它、嫌它、自以为自己愚钝，她便永远是隔岸的花。仰慕只是远眺，热爱才是涉水而行；愿意把一生押给“我可能学不会”的东西，才是真正的热爱。

People often say “A is too hard, B is too high.” If we turn away the moment we hear “hard,” the day we truly “can” will never arrive. Curiosity must go beyond the surface, and knowledge should not be placed on a pedestal. Instead of worshipping its mystery, demystify it—invite it down from the altar. Learning is like dismantling an old radio: we may not understand every component, but at least we discover it isn’t magic.

The world’s knowledge has no end. If we begin by fearing it, disliking it, or assuming we are dull, it will forever remain a flower across the river. Admiration is only looking from afar; love is wading through the water. Daring to stake a lifetime on “I might never master this” is the truest form of passion.
